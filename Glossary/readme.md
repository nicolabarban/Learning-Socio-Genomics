## Glossary

This is a glossary of the most commonly used terms in (socio-)genomics, written in .md. Primary sources: [genome.gov](https://www.genome.gov/).

**[Allele:](https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=4&textonly=true)** An allele is one of two or more versions of a gene. An individual inherits two alleles for each gene, one from each parent. If the two alleles are the same, the individual is homozygous for that gene. If the alleles are different, the individual is heterozygous.

**[Amino Acids:](https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=5&textonly=true)** Amino acids are a set of 20 different molecules used to build proteins. Proteins consist of one or more chains of amino acids called polypeptides. The sequence of the amino acid chain causes the polypeptide to fold into a shape that is biologically active. The amino acid sequences of proteins are encoded in the genes.

**[Candidate Gene:](https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=21&textonly=true)** A candidate gene is a gene whose chromosomal location is associated with a particular disease or other phenotype. 

**[Chromosome:](https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=33&textonly=true)** A chromosome is an organized package of DNA found in the nucleus of the cell. Different organisms have different numbers of chromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes--22 pairs of numbered chromosomes, called autosomes, and one pair of sex chromosomes, X and Y.

**[Deletion:](https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=45&textonly=true)** Deletion is a type of mutation involving the loss of genetic material. 

**[Gene:](https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70&textonly=true)** The gene is the basic physical unit of inheritance. Genes are passed from parents to offspring and contain the information needed to specify traits. Genes are arranged, one after another, on structures called chromosomes. A chromosome contains a single, long DNA molecule, only a portion of which corresponds to a single gene. Humans have approximately 20,000 genes arranged on their chromosomes.

**[Gene Expression:](https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=73&textonly=true)** Gene expression is the process by which the information encoded in a gene is used to direct the assembly of a protein molecule.

**[Genotype: ](https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=93&textonly=true)** A genotype is an individual's collection of genes. The term also can refer to the two alleles inherited for a particular gene. The genotype is expressed when the information encoded in the genes' DNA is used to make protein and RNA molecules. The expression of the genotype contributes to the individual's observable traits, called the phenotype.

**[Genome:](https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=90&textonly=true)** The genome is the entire set of genetic instructions found in a cell. In humans, the genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes, found in the nucleus, as well as a small chromosome found in the cells' mitochondria. Each set of 23 chromosomes contains approximately 3.1 billion bases of DNA sequence.

**[Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):](https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=91&textonly=true)** A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an approach used in genetics research to associate specific genetic variations with particular diseases. The method involves scanning the genomes from many different people and looking for genetic markers that can be used to predict the presence of a disease.

**[HapMap:](HapMap (short for "haplotype map"))** is the nickname of the International HapMap Project, an international project that seeks to relate variations in human DNA sequences with genes associated with health.

**[Histone: ](https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=102&textonly=true)** A histone is a protein that provides structural support to a chromosome. In order for very long DNA molecules to fit into the cell nucleus, they wrap around complexes of histone proteins, giving the chromosome a more compact shape.

**[Homozygous:](https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=105&textonly=true)** Homozygous is a genetic condition where an individual inherits the same alleles for a particular gene from both parents.

**[Phenotype:](https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=152&textonly=true)** A phenotype is an individual's observable traits, such as height, eye color, and blood type. 

**[Polygenic Trait: ](https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=152&textonly=true)** A polygenic trait is one whose phenotype is influenced by more than one gene. Traits that display a continuous distribution, such as height or skin color, are po
