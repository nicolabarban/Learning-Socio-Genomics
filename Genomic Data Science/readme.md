## [Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science)

This is a set of notes relating to the [Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science) specialisation on Coursera. 

They are written in the .tex [template](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/10725-F12/template.tex) borrowed from CS267, Applications of Parallel Computing at the UCBerkeley EECS Department. Some subdirectories (corresponding to each of the 7 (excluding the Capstone) modules in the specialisation) will contain functions in Python and R. The courses are:

1. [Introduction to Genomic Technologies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-genomics)
2. [Genomic Data Science with Galaxy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/galaxy-project)
3. Python for Genomic Data Science
4. Algorithms for DNA Sequencing
5. Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science
6. Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science
7. [Statistics for Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-genomics)
