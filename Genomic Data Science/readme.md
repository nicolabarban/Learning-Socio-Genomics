## [Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science)

This is a set of notes relating to the [Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science) specialisation on Coursera. If you are considering taking just one or two of these modules, the [Algorithms for DNA Sequencing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-sequencing) module is **especially** good.

The notes are written in the .tex [template](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/10725-F12/template.tex) borrowed from CS267, Applications of Parallel Computing at the UCBerkeley EECS Department. There are also some (hopefully) useful functions written in Python and R related to this specialization. The courses are:

1. [Introduction to Genomic Technologies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-genomics)
2. [Genomic Data Science with Galaxy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/galaxy-project)
3. [Python for Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-genomics)
4. [Algorithms for DNA Sequencing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-sequencing)
5. Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science
6. Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science
7. [Statistics for Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-genomics)
